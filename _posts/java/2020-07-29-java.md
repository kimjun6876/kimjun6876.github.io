Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time in one JVM.
A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

The reason we are using Singleton class is we can prevent wasting of memory since we can reuse it by creating object one time.
Also Singleton class makes much easier for us to share between other objects.

However, Singleton class have some drawbacks such as
1. It is efficient but it is conditional.
2. We can't really say it is object-oriented programming because potentially it increases defectability between other objects.
3. It can occur Synchronization processing problem in a multi-threaded environment. 

Basic Singleton Pattern

    public class SingletonExample {
        //Instance
        private static SingletonExample instance = new SingletonExample();
        
        //private construct ====>> it must be private because it prevents other users create this class by using "new".
        private SingletonExample() {}

        public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
            return instance;
        }
    }



Let's modify this code for more efficiency.
I am going to create instance when we need it, not the time when the class loads.

    
    public class SingletonExample {
        //We are just going to declare instance variable, that's it.
        private static SingletonExample instance;
        
        //private construct ====>> it must be private because it prevents other users create object by using "new".
        private SingletonExample() {}

        public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
            if(instance == null) {
                instance = new SingletonExample();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }
    
This style is not bad but it is vulnerable in a multi-threaded environment.
If multiple threads call this function in a same time, instance will be called more than twice and it will cause critical problem.
We can prevent this by using "synchronized" keyword.
    
    
    public class SingletonExample {
        //We are just going to declare instance variable, that's it.
        private static SingletonExample instance;
        
        //private construct ====>> it must be private because it prevents other users create object by using "new".
        private SingletonExample() {}

        public static **synchronized** SingletonExample getInstance() {
            if(instance == null) {
                instance = new SingletonExample();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

This style solved the potential problem that instance can be called several times in same time.
However, using "synchronized" keyword will decrease efficiency and lower the performance.


This is the most efficient way to create Singleton


    public class SingletonExample {
    
        //private construct
        private SingletonExample() {}

        private static class InnerInstanceClass() {
            private static final SingletonExample instance = new SingletonExample();
        }

        public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
            return InnerInstanceClass.instance;
        }
    }
